    "This notebook provides a brief overview of the [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/) [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping), which allows us to access the database using Python objects. We will assume you have some working knowledge of Python, databases ([PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)) and [object-oriented programming](https://pythonguides.com/object-oriented-programming-python/). New concepts relating to the Django ORM will be introduced as we work through the notebook.\n",

    "The objective of the notebook is to get you familiar with Python commands that you can use for accessing the data. By the end of the notebook hopefully you will understand: \n",

    "* How to write data to the database\n",
    "* How to write post-processing scripts using the data\n",
